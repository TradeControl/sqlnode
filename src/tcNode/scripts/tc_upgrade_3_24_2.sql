Fix:
- trigger new current balance when OpeningBalance updated 
- include opening balance in the current balance in new accounts
- cast EntryNumber to int on cash account listing
- include ActivityCode in Invoice.vwSalesInvoiceSpool
- exclude vat entries from Cash.vwStatement for un-registered businesses
- forward invoices with multiple lines not totaling in Cash.proc_FlowCashCodeValues

Instructions:
This script should be applied by the TC Node Configuration app.
It inserts the upgade into App.tbInstall.
